Its ice cream cone is the best part of this branch,4
"The drivethru line at this location is, had been, and will always be broken. Dont ask me why, because i do not know. Maybe it is because the 3rd window is rarely used. Idk, but go inside if you have a small order as its faster to go to a register. Check your order when they are super busy as they give you a diet, or another order on occasion. Otherwise my favorite place to get a large coke, for $1$.",4
"Stopped here after picking up my brother from school, there was a bit of a line but it moved pretty fast and the food was absolutely fantastic usually mcdonalds is hit or miss in multiple areas this location was fast service and really fresh food!!!!!",5
Service was quick despite longer line. Order has always been correct. Staff is friendly.,4
Fries are always good. Ice cream is ALWAYS not working,3
Same as any other McDonald's.,4
Homeless hang out ! Every day customers are being attacked in the store why security guards stand around and watch !,1
Just had a quick coffee and pastry. Hit the spot when in a rush.,5
Pure attitude from young lady at window.  Not a place I will go to ever again.,1
Terrible,1
Horrible food is low quality,1
A godsend locationwise,5
Ice cream cone was perfect.  MC DONALD diet coke is the closest thing to coke zero since they calibrate their machines for a perfect soda and purify there water.  THANK YOU MC'DS,5
Horrible service. Closed before time posted. Dirty,1
Slow service,1
Cold food long waits,1
Service is too slow and the cashiers have no manners the place is under no order need new management,1
Speed of service was an opportunity during my stay. Look like the manager was like kicking out an homeless man but he wanted water. I would just give it to him cause its hot out but I guess she was looking ou,3
Quick and courteous.,5
Fries were hot!! Sandwiches made as I requested!!!,5
Fish Filet all the way. Always has been my favorite. Stupidly good sandwich.,5
Slow service. And we were the only ones in there  Found hair in my food. If I could give no stars I would never comming back,1
Good ,4
Ordered using their self serve machines. Sat at the table as per the instructions on the machine. Waited 15 minutes. No food. Politely asked the manager behind the counter and they had missed our order and thought it had been prepared. No apology just a rude manager telling us to sit down and it will be be brought to us,1
3 people running the store with like 30 customers on pending orders. Completely disorganized.,1
Store is unprofessional not open during business hours. When does that happen at mcdonalds. Not a good look.,1
Yummy,4
bad service,1
Horrible staff i was forced to hurry up and eat by security so someone else could eat comfortably without being bothered i spent my hard earned money in there i should be able to take my time to eat.,1

"The McDonalds experience is that you can find the same on every single establishment but what really makes a difference and makes you come back is the way the employees treat the customers, on this specific McDonals the manager (Timothy) makes such a good j",5
Now I know now I know why I stopped eating there,1

"Horrible service... waited over 40 min for my cold food! No one wanted to speak up but i did, manager turns around and tells me we are short staffed but no excuse for them dragging their feet and cracking jokes to each other...total opposite of a FAST food joint. I would of had better luck and service an actual sit down place..",1
Excellent ,5
We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke.. we only get a drink there I'm so we only go to for the play area and since it's broke my son has been very sad,2
The food is the same each week but it's not that good,3
A quick snack,2
"drive thru is hell!!!! if you are thinking to go thru the drive thru... are you willing to spend 15-20 min?!?!? hell to the no! not just the drive thru is the issue but the fries is burnt and stiff, the coke is FLAT! also make sure to have cash because they will surprise you ""at the moment we are not accepting card payment"" pretty much thats my experience here...",1
"Tried 3 of the kiosk to order my food. Never completed an order on a kiosk, something different wasn't available on each one. Busy as hell, took a long time to get my food. Never again",1

It was a great McDonalds. We used it as a meeting spot before. We used it to change clothes after the storm. It was just a great place to meet eat and greet.,4

Found it unwelcoming that food has to be paid at kiosk and no option for human interaction.,5
They don't know the definition of costumer service.  Wrong order twice on 1 day.  They respond so rude . Horrible experience avoid this place,1
The Spanish lady in the Drive thru was extremely rude. She was trying to charge me $9 for two sandwiches that clearly had a sign for 2 for $3.50. Unreal,1
The best,5

We waited in the drive thru for 30 minutes. It was late after visiting the parks all day and they were close to our hotel. I would stay clear of this disaster of a restaurant.,1

"The play area is nice and clean. Food was normal, not bad, just regular McDonalds food. The place was clean except the bathroom in the play area",3
I always order the same 4 orders of the 20pc Nuggets. For some odd reason its $12 more expensive at this location than all the other stores in the metroplex. If you like to spend extra money for the same exact thing you can get from another location for cheaper than this is your spot. For me its not. The manager g,1

"Went for late lunch and it was pretty busy. However, security was on top of it for everything including making sure tables were cleaned immediately after someone left. All in all a good experience",5
The food was good bit the service was awful! The cashier got an attitude because I asked if my order was right! Then on top of that the person handing out an order did the same thing because I asked for ketchup!,2
"Is not a 24hr place, just stop at 5am by the drive through the lady said they closed",3
Its McDonald's,1
Worse McDonald's on the strip dirty an employee's have a attitude,2
"Food is always good,fresh, and fast .",5
God bless McDonald,5
The cashiers seem to have no idea what is going on. Mess up orders. Literally give small portions. Ordered a sandwich and they gave me one of smallest chicken that i've seen. I wouldn't recommend this place. Find a better McDonalds around.,2
McDonalds taste horrible through postmate,1
"The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonald's was because of my youngest daughter. But what we experienced today put an end to it. The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area. As you noticed, there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case. The associate, instead of been polite, talked to us in a not too pleasant tone. I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up. Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience. I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience.",2
"Very busy site, a clean as it could be,",5
The guard that works in there be harasses me every day I go in there I can't even enjoy my meal,1
Very fast with your order. Great coffee. They make it exactly as asked. Love going here.,5
Trouble place lobby says 12am close an they close it 10:30,1
Typical McDonald's but food quality is good.,4
Worst service I've ever had waited over 45 minutes in the drive thru for a 10 peice nugget meal..... workers didn't seem to know what there job was!!! Manager looked lost by what it appeared from the window.,1
They can't get the right order most of the time,2
Very good quality price,5
Not good for health as we all know but a little good food,2
I went through the drive-through and ordered a double Mac meal. I received a single Mac meal And the food was cold. I drove away and call back and told  Them  my meal was wrong. The manager tells me on my next visit I will receive a complimentary order. NO how about giving me the right order or given me my money back. I gave this McDonald's the benefit of Benefit of the doubt is not my 1st Bad Experience in this McDonald's. But it will be my last as I will never visit this McDonald's again.,1
Slow.,4
"My quarter pounder with cheese was old, cold and dry.",1
"A friendly and responsive staff delivered (twice after I brought it back) coffee that was not hot. After the second time, I just gave my cup to my daughter whose iced coffee was way too light with cream and diluted. Surprised that McDonalds quality control failed on this visit.",2

I don't trust this place and I don't even trust sitting anywhere. And for anyone's sake, don't ever go to the restrooms. I'm surprise this place is still running and hasn't shut down. Gross!",1
Fast and hot food.great place for the kids to play.,4
"The park was amazing, LOVED IT! but the bus exit for the parking lot was HORRIBLE.  Needs to be designed choreographed and thought out better",3
Used drive-thru around 2am just to find out that they were only taking cash because the card terminal was not working. I only had a few bucks cash to spend and I even got my oder wrong. Terrible experience!,1

"Drive thru cashier completely got my order wrong.  She order what she saw on register and not what I wanted.  Then look surprised when I told her.  The manager should not let her work drive thru. Which explains why the line was so long.  I'm sure I'm not the only order she screwed up. Don't normally post these comments,  but it's becoming more of the norm these days.",1
Always ready for good comforting meals!,4
Almost $4 for one small breakfast biscuit is outrageous!!!!!!!!!,1
"Located right on Waikiki Beach so it's usually pretty busy. But my experience has been that the service is usually quick, and the food is good. Best not to go after hours or late into the night, so be warned about that!",4
The lady at the drive-thru window was so rude and angry (for no reason) that I cancelled my order and drove away. The lady would only answer with one word answers and was not even polite. Drove to BurgerKing across the street where I was treated nicely and my order was completed with no problems or childish employees.,1

Closed restaurant even though it,1
Lovely location however due to self service on the pop the general public/homeless frequently entered the restaurant to take free pop and ice.,3
"Perhaps the most poorly run McDonalds in Texas. Visited on the weekend,  so naturally busier, but the management, attitude of employees, and physical condition make this a location, in my opinion, the worst location weve ever visited.
1. Trash everywhere, see pic for example. Trash on the floors, tables, parking lot.
2. Dirty tables. Obviously tables get dirty. So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitors",2
Food order wrong and cold! This place is on a downward spiral. Used to love coming here because my order WAS hot when I got it and correct! My sister and I go on french fry dates and McDonald's fries are our favorite. Hard to find good McDonald's fries any more. #hatescoldfries,2
"Ridiculous.. i am not one to ridicule, this is pure ridiculousness... I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they can't even get a kids meal right... you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples... I received  double fries,  no nuggets, as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets. I tried calling when I arrived back. No one answered the phone!!! Here is your negative review that could've been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues",1

Everything was good during oiut visit.   The staff was friendly and the service was prompt.    The food was hot and fresh.  This is where we go after our visits to the Dallas Zoo!,5
"Not rated one star for this McDonald's, they actually happen to be a solid and enthusiastic group of people always willing to ensure your happiness and satisfaction. I just think McDonald's sucks in general. That being said, the staff at this specific restaurant is quite friendly and approachable, and I've never had a bad experience with the food or anything. They're usually quick and the food tends to be accurately prepared. In a world where this distinction mattered, I'd actually call this a really ""good"" McDonald's, but the significant other is bummed about their removal of garlic fries, and the ice cream machine is hellof broken all the time. Anyway. Bring vegan items to McDonald's.",1

"Number of times we've ordered from this McDonalds: 3
Number of times they've gotten the order right: 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. ""Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun."" It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

I give up. #FightFor15, indeed",1

Id give it zero starts if I could. The drive through only had two cars ahead of me to order and in total it took an hour. It took ten minutes no exaggeration at the order board for someone to take my order. When i get to the window he didnt know what i had and literally just then put my order in. It was not that busy at all and it had at least 4 people working. At the window he took my card for about two minutes and i froze my bank account just in case,1

Not even an exchange of words when I got my food (which I had to order online from inside the restaurant because no one was there to help me). Not a you're welcome when I said thanks. Nothing!!!

I ordered a bacon smokehouse meal. The lady asked chicken or patty. No where on menu did it say chicken. The only thing I received correct with my order was the drink. I ordered beef and I received the chicken only. I ordered the meal and didn't receive my fries. Then the receipt said sandwich only with chicken.

The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.",2

"It's McDonalds. The food is consistent McDonalds, ordering is through the sel-serve kiosks or drive-through.",4
Inconsistent in ther preparation of food and pricing.  Instead of charging for meat substitution I was charged like I was adding additional meat.,3
"One and half hour for burger in drive line. Disaster and disappointed. Few cars before me but took forever.
I saw all bed reviews but nobody cares probably.  Prices so high,  quality so low and bad service.",1
They got my order wrong walked away with my debit card my food was cold.  They could not speak English.  Awful location,1
The dining room said open until 3:30am and it was closed by 10:30pm.,1
"Can't complain, I love the grab and go style as I'm looking to catch a bacon egg and cheese biscuit and the 707 train to--",4

"Meals and counter service have improved. Open 24 hours to a diverse crowd of locals, tourists and visitors.",4
"Was very  slow and was not clean, homeless in and out asking  for money and not food",1
This place has clean restroom. The parking is free but is mostly full and requires some wait to park. The dining area is not so big but clean. The cashier was friendly and welcoming. I like that breakfast was served all day.,4
Always fresh when I go there and the staff are friendly never have an attitude like at other McDonald's,5
"Family place,great food",5
A misery no hot coffee no fruit juice and almost nothing in breakfast. Terrible when you come for lunch. And the sanitary facilities open with a room. The greatest anything from Mac Do. Never seen,1
Good food good service,5
Very badly,1
Boring fast food joint.......not the same any more,2
"You have never experienced a food establishment like this one before. Probably because they've all been shut down. I've been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macy's for many many years and it's the same experience everytime. At this point, I do it for the entertainment. The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster, just for starters. But you will usually wait 30-45 minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out. If you're lucky enough to get your food, and it seems edible, there's 0% chance the dining room will be open. With all that said, it's not even the worst part. The staff are the craziest, rudest, nastiest human beings you will ever experience. They have zero filter. They scream and curse at eachother and the customers. One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce, as if there's something wrong with that. After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out, telling me it was $1. For 1 sauce. It was the best entertainment I've ever received for the money.",1
"The day workers are very rude and disrespectful especially the girl who takes the order , I had the worst experience ever .",1

"I eat McDonald's twice a month and not once his it disappointed me,but i would never give it more then 3 stars",3
For fast food it is good food! clean restaurant and nice people!,4
Most ordering kiosks working and staff is friendly. Bigger and newer than the other McDonald's that id's in the n next street.,5
I eat here almost 3 times a week! Great food. Not unhealthy like people say!!!! (According to that movie 'Supersize Me' I should be obese and having a heart attack right now) but im not..... I'm nowhere near out of shape.. but maybe I'm just Bionic.,5
really good food and good service,5
Excellent ,5
"In store experience is generally better than delivery. Order breakfast for my whole family, all that was delivered was 2 orange juices. When I asked the driver he said he even asked if there was any food and stated the employee said no. Not sure who would only order orange juices, for the trouble and price the corner store juice is way better. Deliveries need to be handled better, not the first time missing items or a whole order.",2

Crystal was the manager the night i was in. she was very attentive she listened to me and right away solved my issue and gave me such a nice dining experience that night thank you so mush crystal and your wonderful staff.,5
Good drive through service. And the tell-tale fish filet sandwich was cooked perfectly.  I would ask people leaving the drive through to NOT come back out onto the 16th street because it causes havoc at that light.  Please follow the signs around to the left.  It's not that far out of you won't have to be rude and prevent people from turning right on red.,5
"The general manager of this location had the worst customer service I have ever experience! I order food , it was cold. He initially didnt wanna give me fresh food or a refund, I sat at the drive Thur almost 30 minutes waiting . Once he seen I wouldnt leave he gave me back partial payment and then called the police on me. I ",1

They must have been busy before we got there cause the store looked nasty,2
Im giving it a 1 star because i bought a lot of burgers and fries and they only gave me 2 ketchups. I asked for more ketchup the worker said they cant give more it was  mcdonalds  rules.  MCdonalds is making it hard to enjoy these burgers and fries with no ketchup.,1
This McDonald's is right by my house and really the only reason I continue to go. Service is excellent but I'm missing something from my order every single time I go. Having to go thru the hassle of getting out and going inside really defeats the purpose of going through the drive thru,3
Cheap food,5
McDonalds is McDonalds nothing else needs to be said...,3
Fast and quick but don't forget to ask for napkins and ketchup. They don't automatically put them in the bags.,4
This is a nice location to go and grab a quick meal or snack. The lines are not usually that long and the restaurant itself is usually very clean and comfortable. We often go there. I definitely recommend this location to anyone who likes McDonald's. The prices of course are also very reasonable and the turnaround time is usually very fast. Two thumbs up.,5

"The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order.  I'm a local and I wouldn't ever go back to this location again. Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area.  Also, clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English. This is difficult if you're trying to ask anything of the clerk.  Would not recommend.",2

It's been that way for years and the other day I went through for the 1st time in 4 years and had the exact same result since I lived in the neighborhood adjacent to this McDonald's. Nothing has changed in 4 years, that has to bad thing right?",1

Good,5
"Surprise up charges, then they blame you for it. I won't return to this location again.",1
"Not a very pleasant McDonald's to visit.
#1 the area for the lines is small. So expect to be cramped when it's busy, and be confused as to where the lines are, and where they start.
#2 the employees are not friendly, I wouldn't say they're mean, but they obviously don't care about any pleasantries, or seem to care about you.
#3 there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins, or ketchup, or straws. You have to go up to the counter and ask them for packets and straws and utensils, during lunch time when lines are longer and it's getting congested at the counter, it makes it worse when people have to constantly come up to the counter and ask for something.

I don't recommend coming here if you want to stop and relax for food.",2

I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager. Like how unprofessional and rude this mcdonalds was.",1

The creaminess was slightly thinner than I was hoping and there was a palatable butternut squash undertone that was confusing my palette. Nevertheless, not bad for franchise pina.

"Got the 20 peice mc chicken nuggets and a large fry. The nuggets we're fine, but the Fry's we're stale and that made me sad. The fries can be the best part of the meal. I know that I could have and should have returned them... But I didn't.",4
"Most have no idea the historic significance of this McDonalds.  Back in the 60's ALL McDonalds restaurants were drive-ins....meaning no indoor seating.  You ate in your car (or standing outside).  Oak Park had an ordinance that stated ""no drive-in restaurants"" but Ray Kroc (founder of McDonalds wanted a McDonalds in his home town).  So in order to get approval to be built, THIS very McDonalds,  agreed to install stand up (hi-top) tables inside so technically you could eat inside.  It was to my knowledge the first McDonalds ever where you could sit inside and eat.  As I recall, it opened in/around 1966 or so.  It was a VERY big deal around the area.",4
Was in the drive thru for 45 minutes. Ridiculous!,1

"I rarely eat fast food but yes it was open late and we needed food.
Only one ordering computer open, such a large restaurant limited to such a small area and no bathroom. Really makes no sense.
Super slow service and the people that come here are super questionable. One guy was so far gone I dont think he knew he was at McDonald",2

"This is a 24/7 location, which is great. The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling people. Also, the layout is a bit odd. It narrows significantly in the middle of the store, making it hard to get through to the doors and the counter at busier times.",4
Slow service employees in the back using bad language leaving customers waiting to order,1
"I work five minutes away from this store, so I go there all the time. Everytime I go there's a problem. This time my bun was so hard. The bottom bun. There's always something wrong. I worked for this same company for a lot of years,(swing manager). It's crazy. I've only got good service once or twice there.",1

I like it... Who wouldn't it has wi-fi ,4

"This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to. They were closed for several months due to construction. The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational. The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft. The best thing about McDonald's are the FRIES!!!!  Their fries are always fresh, hot, and delicious. The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures. I don't mind waiting in the sometimes long drive-thru line for fresh food. Thank you for having pride in the food you serve.",5

"Horrible service, waited 10 minutes plus to get service, the ""Manager"" showed up and said she was busy she could not take my order",1
there was a hair in our food,2
They're rather consistent at this McDonald's. The food obviously taste the same everywhere so I don't feel I need to speak on that aspect. The workers listen and it's a quick eat everytime I go on my break so I can't complain,5
15minutes for a drink. Toilet worste than a war field. Everywhere dirty. No enough space. No receipt from the machine to order... Avoid this place!,1
Interesting McDonald's like the animal theme nice place to bring the kids,3
The 1am occurrences here are a definite reason to stop by.,4
"Horrible customer service, if I could do 0 stars I would. No receipt and the food cold",1
"I wouldn't normally write a review, especially for a McDonalds that I go to often, but recently I have been going through the drive through and have seen a man that has twice as much enthusiasm as anybody else working there. I believe his name is Brandon, but every time I go he always seems to brighten my day.",5
"Always takes longer than any other drive-thru. Advertises that the drive-thru is open 24 hours (both online and with signage at the store), but it isn't.",1
Good service during the day night manager ,4
"Horrible service- stood there for 20 minutes trying to pay 6.00 for my food. Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others, workers were in back play fighting. Drive through line was around the building and over 12 customers in line. After 20 minutes, asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register- she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away. She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food. Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds.",1
I will never never come back. Bad service! The waitress in red just ignored me when I ask her something.,1
"We went there tonight to get food for our family. The order was all messed up and the buns on all the sandwiches were hard as rocks.
Very disappointed in McDonald's.... I really like McDonald's but it looks like I'm going to have to start going to Burger King again ",1
Fast service with call in ordering for faster service.,3
This is a very friendly restaurant.  Even when they are busy they seem to find a way to smile. Some do need to check their attitude at the door but for the most part they are usually very accommodating and service is typically good.,5

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I ordered a cone and it was a tiny pitiful looking excuse for a cone so I asked the manager [who made it & handed it to me] to remake it the correct size and way. He said 50 cents..it looked like a childs cone..he said you can pay 50 cents or take the cone..I kept insisting he remake it..he suggested to refund my money and I took it and went to Wendy's!! it was crazy how rude the manager and the staff were. I've worked for mcds before and the service I received was extremely below par. Never going to this mcds again.,3

"Terrible. In line for over an hour and my whole order was messed up. First they told me over the drive thru intercom that they don't do the coupon on the app then told me to pull around after taking my order. Make matters worse was the one worker kept scratching her hair, her hoody on her head, then take it off and scratch hair again. Not once did she wash her hands, but had the nerve to be mad at me because your coworker didn't ring up the order correctly. Definitely will not be coming back to this one. I'm glad I'm on my way back home to Texas, so I can get some Southern Hospitality.",1
Favorite themed McDonald's!,5

This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's,2

Wow only if this had a negative scale index because I would've given this particular McDonald's a negative -5 for the service and upkeep.. The food was cold and they had around 3 people passed out and drooling on the table 1 in the restroom some lady which my daughter could not use the restroom fire the entire visit.. Any ways this place needs help,1
Out of ketchup had to get packets of them. Cashier seems a little stressed.,4
Security was nice and open the door for my sister and I to enter. I got on the line to make a purchase and my sister went to use the bathroom. She informed me of a worker or manager sitting down harassing her for a receipt just to use the bathroom. All the workers are hard at work and this lady is sitting down asking for a receipt. If theres a customer only restroom why not,1
"Please make sure you check your order,  I was given the wrong order. I was almost home by the time I found out.",3
Arrived starving from water park.30 minutes after ordering large order of food( no deals on that was on other branches) still no food so asked staff who said would look into it. 45 minutes later one staff arrived with sandwich only out of 4 meals and desserts saying rest coming. 1 hour later rest of order arrived no desserts and on checking burger brought was wrong. Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service. Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize. Will never be back. If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service.,1
"Hello

I was stunned to read reviews of this location on Google.  Not our experience at all.

My wife and I both agree that this was the finest, cleanest, friendliest McDonalds we have ever been to ... dating back to the mid 1970's!  That's a lot of McDonalds all across Ontario, Quebec and probably 30 states in the USA.

We stopped on our way through for a quick bite at about 11:30 a.m. Thursday May 9 and again at about 1:30 p.m. Monday May 13.

We loved the staff, the patriotic decorations and just the overall welcoming atmosphere.

What a place.  Hope they keep it up!",5
Awesome strawberry milkshake..,4
Food order wrong. 1 person taking orders and serving drive up orders and counter. To long of wait.,1
Switching over to the computers to order which takes a while to find what you want on the screen and customize it. Orders took a long time to be prepared and the worker gave my milkshake to the wrong person before he said he didn't order one,3

Cold fries. Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasn't melted.  The m&ms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out.  $18 is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter. Then subpar at best.,2

Don't get the breakfast burritos they advertise a nice beautiful looking burrito on their menu and then when you get it it's a quarter of the size of which they advertise the price has gone up on these and the quality has gone way down they have false advertising on their menu,1

Had to go up and ask for lids because they had not stocked anything in the lobby. I willing to give places like this a second chance if I see effert... But I saw none from the staff. It was not remotely busy and staff still did virtually nothing to improve the cleanliness of the lobby. Needless to say I will not be returning.",1

We were there at 9pm today in case any manager wants to speak with the girl I had to deal with (she is wearing glasses and was the one delivering the orders). We ordered 2 menus, 2 shakes and a sundae. The waiting wasnt long at all. She calls us and give us the sundae then move along.

"Tried the McPlant for the first (and last) time. Would have been better eating an actual plant. Good thing they drown it in mayo and ketchup or it wouldn't have had any taste at all. The fries were warm at best and had been sitting there for awhile. I'm gonna stick with Burger King for my plant based burger, plus they have onion rings.",1
The staff is not good. Rude. Didnt even heaitate to take my order. I was trying the screen when The manager came and took another persons order and then i gone to him and had the order taken. He was helpful and in 2 mn my order was ready. Had some beggars on premises asking for money. Was not busy. Had lots of free seats.,4
Used to be a great McDonald's but since they rebuilt it hasn't been the same.,3
Big Mac and fries plus a drink for 6 dollars Really good thank you McDonald's app,5
Sign's all say 24hrs...printed paper on drive thru menu board...we will reopen at 5am due to system being down. Doubtful...at least they could be honest...will reopen at 5am because we can't find anyone to work overnight. This has been going on for nearly two years now.,1

A drink we didn't order, an apple pie we didn't order, an ice cream we didn't order, and one 10 piece nugget. In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order - our bad, I guess, but our not checking closely enough just doesn't excuse just not getting 40+ $ worth of food.

"Absolutely awful, get your stuff together McDonalds. Yes, their food tastes good but the place it's self is horrid. If you are in a rush which most of us are since it's fast food, don't come to this one. Without a doubt they will get your order completely wrong. They have literally messed up my order 3 times in this past week. I order iced peppermint coffee, and they never give it to me even though it says it on my receipt, it';s always hot coffee they give me. One of the orders messed up my coffee so bad that it was just a hot coffee with just creamer in it, no sugar or flavor(even though I asked for iced peppermint mocha). I ordered 2 pies and they didn't even give me them, plus picante sauce comes with the breakfast burritos yet they never give me it either. Mess up my McChicken just about every time I order it. This happens very often but this time it threw me over the edge since it was so frequent this week. Champlain's McDonalds is the worse by far that I have been to.",1

I had a coupon for a free MC ribs with the purchase of a sausage egg n cheese mc griddle and two Big Mack's.  We didn't get none of that anyway.  We got other stuff instead of popcorn.,5
ALOT smaller inside after the remodel but staff is also ALOT friendlier than they used to be too,4

Great place even for a McDonald's and the staff are kind and always willing to help. No problem getting your food changed and the lines are never too long.,4
Good food great service,5
Can't take an order. I ordered 2 happy meals and they recorded one. At the pay window I corrected their mistake and paid for two. Then at the second window they only gave me one and insisted I only paid for one. They absolutely refused to give me 4 little nuggets and a couple of fries. This is the McDonald's closest to my house and I go there frequently. Well not anymore. I hope the $4.99 they stole from me with make up for the $40 I typically spend there weekly.,1

Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the ""Fast Food"" label.
From order to recieving the food, it took 42mins, and even then the order came out wrong.
There was one manager, one fry cook and one burger cook, trying to complete a dinner time rush, yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so.
This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time, because this really was a poor attempt at ""fast food"".",1

Or make such sloppy orders. Have some pride in what you give out to people who pay, especially high fees from ubereats. Like come on seriously get it together its not that hard. How irresponsible can you be, even at work. Like I know it",1
Have a drive through though it's typically faster to just go inside. Car lines can be a bit slow.,3

"horrible experience, just drive for 3 more min to the Anderson lane McDonalds!
I got there at 6:45am and opening time is listed as 5am. I was waiting at the drive through speaker for 10 minutes, NOBODY even said anything. I drive up to the order window and see another car that was there ever since I got here, parked, waiting for food for forever. The payment window was empty. I parked and decided to order inside but the door was locked, even though they were OPEN! the 2 employees inside were just standing there doing nothing, they saw me knock and purposefully completely ignored me.
Maybe they are understaffed but not an excuse to be so disrespectful to a knocking customer and NOT even put up some kind of sign or open the door to a knocking customer to let them know whats going on! There were other cars behind me that were just waiting for a 5am opening McDonalds to kindly start working after 7am?!

"horrific service. this is NOT the ""world's largest McDonald's"" as people are reviewing on here, this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC. ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes (this did not include waiting for the food), the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him, did not correctly take our order, would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time. i have never in my life been to a McDonald's with worse service. avoid at all costs",1

"So I ordered from door dash.  All my French fries were missing and I have 5 children all the sundaes and McFlurrys were missing.  I called door dash and got credit for the missing items but as those of you know you dont get dash fee and delivery fee and tip credit when the items missing so I lost that money.  I reordered all the missing items which included 3 Oreo McFlurrys,2 fudge sundaes and one Carmel.  I received 2 sundae and 1 McFlurry.  Get door dash credit again but again loading the fees and tip.  I try and call the store so the manager could at least talk to the parties who were making and packing and checking the order and tell them just be careful and pack everything on the receipt. Just read it and check it. But no first 3 calls it rang a few times and went to message that this store cant answer calls anymore. It late it not rush hour at  care is taken to ensure the quality of the food they put out.  Very disappointed in this store. ",1

Worst McDonald's I have ever been to.,1
"This was a horrible experience and a waste of 4 hours and almost $100. The place was terribly overcrowded and dirty. There was standing room only, shoulder to shoulder. We stood in line for 20 minutes at a kiosk to order, then after we ordered it said there was an error and we had to wait another 40 minutes in the line at the register anyway to order. All of the workers were super rude. I was even on the elevator with 2 workers talking about a customer saying ""I have no obligation to answer your questions or do anything for these people"" and then talking about how gross a customer was and saying she would point her out to the other employee. Nobody was at all helpful and even seemed to be angry when we asked for anything.  My daughter tried to fill her cup with sweet tea and the older lady standing at the drink station didnt let her fill it up all the way. The only nice person was the old guy emptying the trash on the 2nd floor. We spent over $60 for my kids to play the arcade games, then they shut and locked the prize counter. A while later, we had to ask someone to open it so they could redeem their tickets and 3 employees tried over the course of the next hour and no one could get it back open. I tried talking to a manager about it, but she gave me about 10 seconds of her time just to tell me there was nothing she could do but send someone up to the ticket counter for us... she didn't even listen to us explain that it others had tried before she just walked away. We are from out of state and my kids were so excited to see this place but we all left miserable. At least the sandwiches were warm (though the fries were soggy).",1
"Everything seemed a little ""dry"", and our fries were only lukewarm.",4
Ordered a steak bagel during breakfast through drive-thru. I had a very long wait. The bagel was good and was as expected from a McDonald's. My experience having to wait a while is about 50/50 at this location.,3

"The workers there are not professional,i went in there to get my morning coffee and heard one of the girls using profanity and customes can over hear them, then the cashier told me to give her a second and she went to the drive through window and start taking customers at the window while there was already someone there handling the drive through customers, i stood at the cash register close to 20mins to place my order, then on another occasion i placed my order on the mobile app the young lady made my ice coffee and left it by the machine , another team member asked what i was waiting for i then told her my ice coffee the girl that made it told her im waiting on my ice coffee too 30mins later im still standing there without my coffee then the girl turned around and saw me standing there still then saw the coffee sitting there and eventually handed it to me, and note i was the only customer left in the McDonalds, other customers came in placed their order got their stuff and left a long time ago, im suggesting more training for these individuals working at this location. I have observed this for a while now and said nothing. I turn my head everytime i pass there now, if you're running late for work i suggest walking through the drive through you'll get your order more faster than going in.",2
Rude and unattentive staff.   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me.  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way.  I turned around and walked out the door.,1

It is next to a club and i am sure a burger sounds better after drinking, but anyway back to the inconsistency. I show up everyday at 2:45 am and sometimes i can get a qtr pounder and other days they say it's not on the late night menu. What really bugs me is that several time I am told breakfast only! No ody shows up at that time for a mcgriddle. Stop being lazy and make the food. Most of the breakfast is ready to slap together and is why they do it, but i show up before 3 am and I want a burger! Why can't the staff get their stuff together as i wrote this review 3 people drove off because they did not want breakfast either.",1

The store was very busy and full of customers. I didn't like the way they greet the customers and the way they talked to each individuals. It was busy and that can't be an excuse for bad service. Food was great as usual but service gotta improve by mile. The cleanliness was an issue also as there were napkins pretty much all over the place. I guess it was not cleaned since evening. May be business is the priority which is not what Mc does I believe.,4

Missing 1 large French Fries. Wrong honey mustard instead of sweet and sour (had to pay 10 cents per sauce packet. Very slow service.

Young man on speaker does not listen to order and does not type it on the reciet all the time, girls in front are always lost and if something is written on the receipt they still don't read it. They also get annoyed when you ask for stuff to be fixed like more cream in coffee, or a sauce you did not which goes with the meal that was on the receipt, etc. Also very sloppy throw food in bag upside down like nuggets or tenders,  also don't wrap the sandwiches well and the papers all greasy, ketchup on top of fries. Always try to get orders out on an unrealistic timer ever for a fast food place and once that happens they close out the order and make you pull to the side to wait for food while 3, 4 people behind get to leave with there orders. It's ridiculous! Just give the whole order at the window this isn't a race and people everywhere else have to wait there turn to complete there orders and go. The weekend crew is even worse!",1

Food is consistently good though.",2

Ordered a chicken sandwich only to get home to find out I got a burger and since I was the only car in the drive through  not sure how that mistake could happen,1
The food wasn't fresh and over cooked,1
Good workers just in a bad area customers are rude,3
The self check out are down and apparently they dont serve lunch till 1100 on Saturday. This whole experience even with the pilot that shares its location was bad. I did call ahead but i got no answer from the pilot. Their showers and laundry is down they're doin construction but the truck parking lot is kinda tight. If a mom and poped open a truck stop around here id give them business. Also this mcdomalds doesnt have indoor dine in due to covid. If you want to be comfortable and sit in a restaurant and eat come to my home state of fl amd get real southern hospitality. We dont live in fear in fl. I didnt think texas had well i leave it at that. They could at least clean the sitting area even though it has caution tape and looms like a crime scene. A little broom and a mop would make a world of difference but the dust that has accumulated out yhere could give a person a cold. Companies really need to start rethinking this covid kick. With resent events people are going to become more conservative with their money. Oils is about to go up and energy pretty muck controls the market. Might be a good time for companies to become more hospitable,1
Employees too busy window licking to get any order correct.,1

Lady at the desk had my order mixed up with someone else's order and even handed me a different receipt,3
"Newly remodeled, very clean for now. Service was pretty decent, I would say slightly better than average as far as McDonald's is concerned. I love using the app to place mobile orders, much easier that way especially during the lunch rush. Food was, well, it's McDonald's. Pretty average food too.",4
They have destroyed their animal themed building and now it's boring. Not worth going to anymore. Why are McDonald's creating such boring buildings? What a waste of money! It doesn't make sense. It's as if they are deliberately trying to lose money and encourage people to stay away.,1

Not open 24 hours. Hugely misleading.,1
Polite and clean and fast food.,5
"Cleaness McDonald's, friendly attentive staff!",5
"I am not going to hold it too much against that them this particular store is in a part of town where there are a lot of homeless people. Any other restaurant in the same area would have the same struggles. Yes, there are a lot of homeless people in the parking lot and in the store, but there is nothing about this that is threatening to one's personal safety--I say this having gone here easily 100 times (my doctor thanks me). There is also an employee always in the parking lot or the store wearing a black shirt that says ""security"" in big white letters. What this person's actual background is in security is less certain--probably the entire training consists of putting on the shirt. The store is not as clean as one is used to with McDonald's franchises, and the drive-through service tends to be slower. I assume this is because they have a hard time keeping good help. Still, at the end of the day, I am impressed that the workers are generally courteous and the food is generally the same McD's consistency and quality, even with the particular challenges of being in this part of the city.",3
"This is the worst experience Ive ever had at a McDonalds. Waited in line for over 40 mins at the drive thru, then found out my filet-o-fish I ordered was automatically removed from the mobi",1

"This location has slow service and horrible customer service.  The computer order machine was not working,  instead of informing custmers they said nothing. Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong. What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees.  For such a big business  and being involved in so many charities you think , they would emphasize excellent customer service. McDonalds you are slipping.",1

This place sucks beyond belief. Staying in a hotel next door have a semi for my wheels. Knocked on the door ask the manager if I could order a shake and get it at the door. I'm sure you can guess the answer,1
Really comes down to who's working. You will either be surprised at the efficiency and general helpfulness of the staff or you will leave angry and long after you got there.,3
Cheap bugers,2
What a waste of time we were there in line for more than 30 minutes. The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct. We spent 5 minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected . When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it. When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut. The manager  said she put the order together from the receipt. He stated the order screen only holds orders for 25 minutes. Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another.,1

A Spanish speaking customer after me was then able to order not only a milkshake but3 mcflurries. When I inquired about it I was told that it was now fixed although no one has gone near the machine during the time since I was denied IN ENGLISH. I then stepped outside to get my friends and tell them our food was ready, they took the tray and headed up while I put our other friend in an Uber. When I came back in security who had just been no more then 5 feet from me while I ordered, paid, and received my food, made someone come down to confirm that I was a paying customer. If only the counter staff was as particular as the security guard.
I won't be coming back here again, at least until my Spanish is better",1

"Morons running the restaurant. The $6 meal is a rip off. We asked if we could get the same deal but sub a side salad. They said yes then they over charged us and yold us ""oh no substitutions."" Watch your tickets and repeat your order three times so the cashier and shift supervisor understand what you actually want.",1
"This McDonalds stands out from the others. It has great management, friendly fast service, and the food always taste like it should. The restaurant is ALWAYS clean and its connected to a convenient store if you need to grab other things as well or need to get gas. Great location that puts you right back onto the highway if you are traveling and has clean restrooms for the kids!",5
"This place has ZERO customer service. From no one being at the front counter to long waits to get food, to getting your order wrong then getting cold food when they ""remake"" your order. This is one McDonald's you'll want to avoid going to.",1
"After waiting in drive through for 20 minutes,  I ordered a filet o fish and large fries with ketchup,  just to get a regular size fries not even filled to the top either , and a  filet of fish with no tarter sauce , and 1/4 of a peice of cheese.  I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders , and  when I showed them  the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me . She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag . I showed her the bag being empty ,and even made the comment. Even no ketchup.  She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be 5 to 10 minutes, since my lunch is only 30 minutes, I had no choice but to leave.",1
Very slow service,2
"UPDATE 2021: This is a solid restaurant. My food has always been made to McDonald's standards. They have very busy times, which is in part due to their location on the highway in a restaurant area, but also because they are a solid restaurant. Their curbside service gives you an estimate of your wait, which is appreciated, and your food will be delivered by a friendly employee (an improvement from my previous experience). My only complaint is that it's obvious they make your curbside drink far earlier than your delivery, because they come to you partially melted (see the slush below).

This mcdonalds is a heinous cancer on society. They will boot your car if you are there longer than thirty minutes or they assume that you did not eat there. there was a guy hanging out accros the street filming people parking. He had us on camera going into the mcdonalds we had a receipt and he still put a boot on our car. After arguing with him and going over footage and receipts he finally admitted his mistake. What an atrocious piece of garbage company. This experience is the last straw for a sub par fast food restaurant.

@McDonald's corporate you need to investigate this location immediately. The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.,1

Terrible,1
Children make bad employees and simple tasks like filling the fries all the way up don't happen and salt isn't added.,3
Real rude manager refused to take my order and was rude to her helper,1
Mc Donalds today in America cater for the drive in customer. Not the walk in person.,3
They forgot  my drinks and didn't get to have time to stop one the way back to get them,4
Worst experience ever!! They closed the lobby early!! Then the manager found out people were still coming in and started yelling!! The nice officer apologized for her attitude and gave us complimentary drinks for patiently waiting for our burger. She needs to go over a customer service training again or find another job!!,1

It was horrible order from inside and it was a 27 min wait for food!! Ridiculous for 3 meals....,1
Extreme long drive thru wait order food and Uber eats took a hour plus,1
"Worse Mcdonalds Ive been to! Took forever with my order even though it was super slow (2 cars in drive-thru), parking lot is full of trash, we ate in parking lot and I went inside for a refill on my drink and they said they don",1
Why do i come here?,3
This is by far the best McDonald's I have ever been too. They serve you your food very quickly and take your trash. They walk around asking if you need anything and are very friendly. Very clean as well.,5

"Service is slower than molasses in January. Also, the order stations did not print a receipt and when I went to claim my food, they wouldn",1
"I guess when you're in a tourist area you don't have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business. Stale burger buns, cold and burnt french fries.  Medium fries box was about 2/3 full.  Drive thru employee didn't say two words to me beyond the price of my meal.",1
"Don't eat here! Order is always wrong, takes forever, fries are cold and gross. Dining room ""closes"" at 11pm. NOPE! Really closes at like 8pm. Update the hours on your door!!! When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign, THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF!

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff, all the managers, and get new people in there.",1
I'm a McDonalds fan boy and this McDonalds is my least favorite in Los Angeles if not the entire United States. It used to be average/ middle of the road as far as MCD goes but recently it's tanked and I wouldn't suggest going here anymore. I'd rather eat at the McDonalds in the airport.,1
Whoever manages overnight is literally the worst. They ignore the drive thru and when you go in they all run to the back and ignore you.,1
Don't come to this mc Donald's. They always takes forever to prepare your food and constantly passes people in front of you,1
A good choice for fast food  in this area.,4
"As always, the drive through screwed it up.  Don't even know why they have it if you have to go inside to get it right.",3
Horrible ,1
Needed a quick breakfast and this was close.,3
Passing through from a volleyball tournament.   Great tasting food with friendly service.  Had bagel nice and hot with fresh hashbrowns.  Definitely recommend if hungry and needing to feed a family fast on budget.,5
they sell burgers here.,5
Inside not open when 5 people in there handicap person needed to restroom very disrespectful,1
"Absolute worse McDonalds I've ever been to.  Restrooms were a mess, ordered food, gave up after 30 minutes and gave receipt to some other folks waiting for their order.",1
"Delivery- complete joke! Don't bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets! I ordered 20 spicy,  40 reg, picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as ""required "" not to mention Desired by my kiddos!! We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup!!! Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard, they didn't even give us straws either to go with our $3 mango smoothies...2 of them! So, 60 Nuggets-NO sauces  AT ALL!  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious!",2
"I have never encountered a restaurant so rude before. We arrived there at 10:53 they close at 11, I know it's tabu to show up at a restaurant right before close, but we were 6 hours away from home and hungry. Not only were the doors already locked, but the three employees plus a security guard would not come to the door or even acknowledge we were there. Locking the doors early when your signs state your hours is unexceptable!!!!",1
Literally the worst McDonald's I've ever been to,1
Angel is a great worker at the drive thru window! Very nice and quick@,5
There tea was nasty and there meal where cold,2
Cant hate on the workers... its Mcdonalds... just dont go to this location. And good luck trying the drive thru if you have plans in the next 2 hours,2
3 stars because it's hit or miss whether your order will be correct or not. Or if they give you utensils to actually eat your meal. 100% check your bag before you leave.,3
Just left the Santa Monica Pier.  Couldn't find an ice cream cone single scoop for less than $6. Thank you McDonald's for having a scoop of Creamy vanilla ice cream for $1.42,5
26min in queue is when the manager tells me i have to make my order in one of the machines because she doesn't have someone who can take my order. Really sad i waist my time and did not get my strawberry shake. International Driveway to busy for this time of the day. They need more personal.,1
The food is what it is but the staff have poor attitudes and are very rude,3

"This McDonald's was excellent,  the staff was courteous and professional and although all I ordered was coffee, it was delicious just as I have come to expect from most of the McDonald's I have been to.

It is comforting to be able to expect consistency from a restaurant,  no matter where I go in America,  so far, there is a better than 90% chance that the coffee, for example,  will be the same thing I am use to and desire.",5
Super friendly staff which is so different when it comes to Mc Donald staff. Every time I go there they seem so happy to be at work and serve. So refreshing. Plus the morning staff manager is so on point and the staff really reflect them well.,5

Fast and hot food!,5
The food was ok but I have experienced better service. They missed things... The tables were in bad condition and the floor was not cleaned since ages.,2
"Terrible.  Simply put, it's not worth your time to stop at this location.",1
They have music as if it were a disco. Here you can not eat you go crazy.,1
The employees are incredibly friendly. I just need the customers to stop throwing their trash on the ground! Respect the Arches!!!,5
Not bad. Could be cleaner.,4
"Fast, friendly, careful and safe",5
"Dirtiest McDonald's we've ever been in, but the food was fine.  Delayed flight so this was the only thing open at 3 a.m. The lobby was open and someone was in the process of cleaning it, she was friendly too. You can only order at a kiosk, which was new to us.",3
Always very accurate. Can hit the drive thru in about 15 mins on an average day.,5
Excellent ,5
"McDonalds always good, very quick with food.",5
Went for the coffee which was fine. But also ordered a breakfast sandwich and a hash brown. They had an excessive amount of grease. Couldn't finish it.,2
Past 2 recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes.  They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing.  Not an example of fast food.,2
"Excellent customer service.
My daughter is special needs and they went above and beyond to assist us.
They greet you and assist you with a smile and a lady was coming around asking if everything was okay and if we were happy by the end of our dinner.
They also keep it very clean and tidy.
And the food was delicious.
Five stars are not  enough.",5

Treated poorly, barely apologized,terrible cust.serv.and fries were cold,burgers bland!:/ no condiments given either!

Waited almost 20 minutes for an order. There were only 5 cars in drive thru and about 7 people inside.  Finally I canceled and went to a sit down restaurant where I got served within 10 minutes.,1

"Bad service, impolite associates. Sprite without taste, no napkins and they said they don't do refill right now! Attend this restaurant soon",1
Nice place for kids to grab quick fries! Close to Hilton Orlando. Just a walking distance if you need something. Next to them there,4
"It's a small McDonald's comparing to other. Very few seating and small seating area. Service and menu is same like other McDonald's, may slight high price. Location is precious, customer moderate at the morning. Customer service good.",3

How incompetent can you be when you have all this staff standing there and no one willing to help the customer- why does a manager have to tell their employees to help a customer?? You see a customer you help them..  On top of that a lady that put her order in the kiosk after I had given mine  was given her order first!!! We literally ordered almost the same things and she was helped before ,1
"Im from floirda and this mcdonalds is so cool because it is so not what im used to-the architectural aspect of it, i mean.",5
I got food poisoning from the Pico de Gallo signature crafted sandwich. This is the sandwich I ate on the parking lot floor,1
Health inspector was there and there was no ice it was a mess and if you look underneath the soda machine there's a river or soda under there probably molding,1
Got hit up by a beggar with 30 seconds of parking.  Beggar then proceeded to move inside to converse with employees.,1

"The low score is for the Maroon Shirt Manager on 4.3.23 who took the phone off the hook and still allowed the app to sell curbside orders that would never be delivered due to the phone being off the hook. Then, making people sit in the lobby and ignore them while she sat and ""responded to surveys."" Well ma'am  here is one for you, since apparently surveys take president over service.

It took the Blue Shirt Manager realizing nothing was being done up front to get anything done. She realized the Maroon Shirt Manager had the phone off the hook for 4 hours, apologizing, correcting issues, and holding people accountable to get anything going.  To her, I am sorry that this is a low scoring survey. She deserves better than that.",1

"This is the worst McDonald's I've ever been to how there still open I don't know the employee at the drive thru was rude, buns were hard, I was missing two burgers out of the order, the nuggets were cold they tasted like they were old if I could give them a big fat 0 I would very disappointed with this restaurant...",1

"It's food, if your hard up.",4
The line on the drive through is very slow and long. So i decided to go inside. It is friday night. On the door states lobby open untill 12am. They have the doors locked and guys dancing and clowning around. One of them opens the door and tells me they can not take orders in the lobby that drive through is the only way. I asked him may i speak to the shift manager. So he went off and came with one of the guys. Not the manager. He said that the owner of the McDonald's closes early. I recommend people to go elsewhere and not here. Is not worth the time.,5
"For fast food taste,  it's the same as every mcdonalds. But this location uses newer tech that allows you to put your order in with out talking to a person.",5

Horrible service. General manager was in the store at the time. Was punishing an employee in front of everybody. Should've been more professional and took him in the back area. I waited 10 minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh. Don't recommend this location unless you can't get to a different location.,2
"The food was good!! The soda was a little weak, but that's not what I go there for anyway. Fast service. Very efficient. The arcade staff could be a little friendlier. But overall we had a great experience.",5
"The service is slow.. 60/40 if the food taste good. And anything more then the 1,2,3 dollar menu the taste aint worth the price.. I think being extremely slow is a all McDonald's requirement tho.",2
Quick and easy using the order yourself tower. Fish ole sandwich was delicious. Thank you.,5
"I haven't been to McDonald's in years and I was surprised how good it was. I have the southwest salad and it was great. I don't know if I would go back for another few years, but I was pleasantly surprised. Also the staff here was super sweet with my little girl to ask to trade in her toy from her happy meal.",5
"This being billed as the largest McDonalds in the world, I had to stop and see it. It is certainly BIG. They have a dessert station, brick oven for pizza and huge play area for the kids. When I stopped it was busy and the employees were friendly and helpful. The restaurant and dining area appeared clean, which is difficult to do in a high volume fast food restaurant. I just grabbed a burger and shake and it was typical McDonalds.",5
My cheeseburgers from my #7 were not put in the bag and I didn't realize until I got home. And no one answers the phone.,1
The restaurant was clean and orderly. Food was prepared fast and made properly. Everything was decent.,4

"This location is adequate. The staff are generally nice. The place is nice looking and inviting. Unless the food is super fresh-off-the-grill, it doesn't warrant the increases in price the last few years. If you want to eat cheap and slightly more healthy, I'd recommend Subway in the strip mall behind McD's.",3
Horrible customer service. Came here for breakfast and the employees are angry/rude and hate their job. They were annoyed the moment they asked me what my order was. I regret coming here and never will again. They forgot to give me my hash browns and were so upset and angry when I told them they forgot and they even denied it. Food was cold. Horrible experience.,1
"I ordered big mac and ice coffee for my lunch , I had 30 min break so I ordered in advance, mobile order, i went there and I see my order on the screen , 15 min later my order is gone from screen no one khew about my order I spend my 30 lunch break waiting they give me a new bbidgmac n ice coffee different what I order !!!! Horrible",1
"They were very rude and food was cold. They refuse to let us inside and made us wait 10 mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY RUDE. Next time I'm in town I'll never go to this McDonald's. They were slow, rude, and not friendly.",1

Service was great but the chicken inside sandwiches were really not well. I had bad stomach for almost 3 days,1
"The worst place ever!
They made us to pay 80 dollars just because we didn't walk in McDonald's first. How horrible is that?!",1
Doing uber eats and postmates for orders here and the location being closed entirely. FALSE. ADVERTISING!,1
"Not enough workers, fries old, food took to long.",2
"The drive through at this McDonald's has always been busy every time I've gone.  It's honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry.  I've been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger.  Granted, compared to In and Out that's nothing, but this is McDonalds.  That aside, the interior has always been pretty clean when I've went inside.  If you go for breakfast on the weekends, once again, be prepared to wait.  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay!  The one time I used it, the person behind the counter actually knew what it was.  So many places tell you they don't have it but just don't know what it is.  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours.",2

"This McDonald's is very low on service . When i first walked there was a smell of something rooting or something else and it just smelled horrible. Everyone that walked i  would seem that . The soda station had trash on it, the tables weren't clean. I also had to wait an extra 10 min for my food but it was already ready but the people were just standing around not calling out my order.i had to go up to them and say is that my order and the guy said i don't know.",1

late night staff is terrible!,1
The drive-through is so slow. Went at night and saw that the line was long but I figured it'll be moving. . . Nope. I was third to last and was in the same spot for like 15mins. It was ridiculous. I ended up backing up and leaving.,1
Only taking cash and I sat in the drive thru for over 30 minutes.,1

"Most unprofessional and rude mcdonalds I have ever been to.
I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke. When I got to work I'm happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both. When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it. I couldn't make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up. Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldn't go pick it back up. When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not. Which it was the same manager. Like how unprofessional and rude this mcdonalds was.",1

Mr. Happy at the Expo looked like his life was over and didnt know anything about customer service.  The iced coffee was basically milk and creamer minus the coffee. I know this is fast food but damn, you guys didnt even try today.",1

Quarter pounder was like warm.  Fries weren't salted.  Pathetic!,1
Hash browns are always cold and under-cooked.,2
Very slow..but clean and wide area to eat in..all in all par for Waikiki..,3
Worst service,1
I work the midnight hours down the street. Stopped by at 0130 and the place was closed. Not a 24 hour operation.,1
"For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger. Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked. Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat. And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger, and sadly I started with the fries. And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt. Never going back. Would rather go to checkers across the street.",2
It's a McDonald's like any other.,5
Good ,4
This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonald's just down the street. $20 for what is normally $10. On top of it didn't even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonald's,2
I went through the drive-thru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location I've now been sitting here over 20 minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonald's to go to seeing as they don't seem to care about their customers,1

Took forever to get our food every day we were there this week when they got very busy. One night we were there for almost an hour waiting in a crowd. I feel like they might have been understaffed because they weren't working quickly. Everything was good and correct but they ran out of one items I ordered so they replaced it with a different flavor.,3
The burger looked nothing like the pictures,1

Found it unwelcoming that food has to be paid at kiosk and no option for human interaction.,5
Out of all carbonated drinks. This is Joe Biden,1
Nice and clean and the employees are very welcoming,5

Literally the best mcdonalds to go to in the early early a.m. but watch out for the overcooked or stale fries. Hardly ever been there and systems updating or down so it's my go to spot when alot of places are closed.,4
Well managed and the food is good. Take it from an ex McDonald's employee,4
Ok,4
Its a Mc,5
"As has been for the last year slow, slow service. Went inside this time, no better.",2
"It's McDonald's, there is a bathroom for customers. Not sure what else I can say.",3
The apple pies here were the worst. It was like biting into a regular apple. The only thing cooked was the outside. The inside was cold and the apples were hard. I went there 12/26/18 to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to eat. I won't be going back there. I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for 2 weeks. (This was their choice of reward for good behavior),2
I mean I guess it's food that is etible but a trash barricade kept me from going inside so I had to use the drive thru,4
Not for me macdonald's but granddaughters loved ordering on screen,5

"This is what I encountered when I came to this location today.  A trash bag wrapped around the door by the security guard to stop ppl from coming in.   So instead of a safe, warm location to order and pickup from, I had to wait on a very dangerous Avenue in NYC while they took their sweet time in making my order.  20 minutes to make breakfast and having to wait on a dangerous street is ABSOLUTELY APPALING",1
"Great time, good food and friendly staff.",4
Manager saw me waiting a little longer than usual and went back to the kitchen to see what was wrong and got back with my order. Very thoughtful!,4

Horrible service from the night shift manager .!! I would also love to speak to a distric manager.!,1
Pretty decent.,3

This MacDonald's has not once given me the correct amount of nuggets. Lately it's been too many but there are several times where they short me. They've gotten my order completely wrong before too. They just seem to struggle a fair amount.,3
"I mean it's  McDonald's. I typically try to stay away from McDonald's but it was the only place open in my area at 1130pm. And no body has sprite like McDonald's usually.The fries were fresh. Definitely should not have eaten the ""beef"" will definitely have your stomach doing jumping Jack's. Lord I bout died on that plane ride back home trying not to traumatized the other passengers and if the sprite doesn't taste like battery acid then it's not McDonald's my sprite was definitely missing the acid",4
"I ordered an M&M McFlurry and paid. Then they handed me an Oreo McFlurry and said they were out of M&Ms. That is not what I ordered so it was very disappointing and annoying, but since I'd already paid there was nothing I could do but keep the Oreo. Then when I asked for my receipt because I didn't want them to leave my credit card info on the counter they started explaining that they're out of M&Ms--a concept I understood even though I was annoyed about it.
Also, the bathroom is gross and the top floor is never open.",1
McDonalds is already a horrible franchise with horrendous service but this location is SO bad that I wanted to write this review to advise NOBODY to come to this location. The service is a joke. The food always comes out wrong. The staff is not fr,1

Always clean and super fast service!,5
always cheerful and always helpful. great service. the only downside is OVER RUN BY HOMELESS PEOPLE all the time!,4
She is out,4
Man. This. Location. Sucks. So. Bad.,1
Service was slow. It took a long time to get food. My friends waited a long time for their food,3
This McDonald's is okay is located right next to Harrah's Casino convenient but the sweet tea was not really that sweet they don't really do bundle deals I'm from the south. I had to wait over 20 minutes for my 20 piece and another lady next to me was waiting on hers it wasn't the cashier's fault but her back crew never drop them but overall I like the McDonald's like I said it's okay,3
Food is always delicious and the fries are always super hot.,5
"What's up with this Lady taking 2 Hours every morning to clean just the men's restroom,this is every morning,and don't even ask her to let you in just to wash hands...she'll send you to ypur house or women's restroom.",2
They literally take forever and they only give you one sauce for an order of 10 piece McNuggets,1

"Super busy, but moved everybody through the line like a boss, food was good and hot.",5
I've been coming to this McDonald's for so long. And it's always dirty. Tables are all dirty.,1
"They have great coffee, but nuggets were below par",3
McDonald's is a really popular place but i think there also very complacent why do they always put there fish fillet half way off the bun i like the taste of the fish but it would be nice if you added lettuce and tomato to the sandwich that's all,3
"I went to this Mcdonld's before the gym.  They have a 2 lane drive through , but there is plenty of seating inside.  I ordered the spicy crispy chicken sandwich, the 10 piece nuggets, the fish sandwich and a large iced tea.  Overall the meal is good.  I wish Mcdonald's had more grilled chicken options.  But the meal is quick and cheap.  It got the job done for a good pre workout. The ordering process is kiosk here at this location, so you can wait in line or use the kiosk.  Overall good",5

Best McDonald's in area. Great staff.,5
It's a bad one go down the road to the next one.,1
Nice people working there,4
"We Canadians get so much less than USA McD's.  I don't even bother going to Canadian outlets unless it was for the $1.00 coffee. Here, everything was done as McD would want...AND served to your table another difference between the two.",5
Super clean,5
Good ,4
Very good,5
"Well decorated, typical micky d's.",4
Makes it easy to grab a quick bite. Self ordering inside,4
The staff was rude and needs training on their people skills. There was no good morning greeting and when asking about menu options it was like talking to a brick wall. The service was also very slow even though it was not busy.,1
Loving it,5
"Was awful at this location!!!! FILTHY!!! Had staff just moving trays of trash around from table to table.. The self pay was out of order, took 15 minutes for someone to notice we were at the registers to pay, with only 2 other customers in the restraunt. Even (while patio obviously ""designed"") patio was horrendous. Trash everywhere, spilled drinks on every table. Very sad since this location I'm sure sees a lot of visitors.",1
The worst I went to this location last night to get some chicken nuggets and fries they had mine food just sitting while waiting for another person in front of me by the time I got my notice they were hard cold couldn't even eat them I'll never go to this McDonald's again,1
"Make sure to check that got your order because they are always either missing my burgers, fries, or sauces. Not sure how when all they have to do is read the screen.",1
A very unique McDonald's since it is next to the Dallas Zoo it has a Zoo theme inside. Nice from the norm to take the children,5

O came through the drive though and the guy there was so nice such a pleasure to be around you could tell he definitely cared about his job to the point where I actually gave him a tip at the window he ended up selling me to buying more than what I anticipated then I got home and of course behold my food was incorrect called back spoke to the manager the manager said absolutely come back in and we will correct it which I did and steaks happened came back through the drive-thru a new manager was absolutely wonderful it's how you handle something that makes it worth going back or not. Mistakes happen.,3
"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty. McDonald's, I'd fix this ladies attitude or I'd find her replacement.",1
"I'll start with the positive: The food I received was the correct order and it was hot. The bad: What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed, and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone. Maybe they're better during the day, but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if you're looking to get in and out.",1
"Last night, I went to buy food around 11:00 pm while I was waiting for my food, I wanted to use the bathroom but it was closed. I asked a short African American boy for the key, who seemed to be the manager because he had a different uniform. and he told me that theres not  bathroom. I told him that I already ordered food and I showed him my receipt, and he answered me again that there is no bathroom in a very rude way... he told me, take your food and go.

By the way, when I entered he ",1
I'm loving it.....,4
"I just came and half of the
Crew was hanging out side the counter, they talk too loud and speak in a very bad way ( n words and Bi.!.!:!)  words is a shame the place is pretty but a has a poor crew.",2

"We know that the order is good quality and we can count on getting exactly what we order.
Thanks",5
"Terrible service, I think hands down worst mcdonalds I have ever been too. Manager wouldn't even come over to help. Absolute joke of a mcdonalds. Go 1 mile down either way and you will be much happier.",1
"This was one of the worse experiences I've ever had.  We sat in the parking lot for 20 minutes waiting for our order.  They forgot about our order.  Then when I got it, it was missing stuff.",1
"The World largest McDonald's is a must to visit if you have kids. Besides the typical menu items, you can order pasta and pizza, customized to order. The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty. Only downside is the wait for the food ... about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it. Of course, the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade (a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from). The place was packed when we visited. Overall a good experience!",5
I was able to get a quarter pounder at 930 am,5
"Order was screwed up, and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw.
Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process. SAD.",2
"I've been waiting in line for 32mins, still no help and I have about 100% chance of them not getting my order right. I hate them!",1
They got the best breakfast here.,5
Love McDonald's Fry's.,4
Excellent experience. Went through the drive-thru and met the kindest employee James. Now let me tell you about James. He was humorous and really made my McDonalds experience one to remember. He made us laugh unexpectedly which was quite a nice surprise. 10/10 would recommend befriending James as he is a wonderful and positive employee.,5
Its location is easy to get to and the employees are kind and professional,4
One step slower in service they would go backwards. By the time you get your food it's already cold.,2
"Tepid food after waiting 15 min is not cool.  Florida McDonald's needs to step up its focus on food preparation.  When their fries are hot and fresh you can't get enough.  But cold #""%$= enough said",3
Great food,5
"The young ladies that work during the day are too busy chit chatting and texting and making the coffees wrong. Cashier at the drive thru window literally handed me my receipt with her head down and other hand texting. Very irritated that I paid for two coffees and it wasn't until I reached my next destination that I realized that they were made completely wrong. Ladies making the coffee were talking and laughing and didn't say hello, or thank you. Very rude.",1
Slow.,2
This was my first time visiting this location. The staff was very nice and service was great. The atmosphere was very good. We just didn't get to visit the second floor because the elevator was closed.,5
Never have a roblem here.,5
"I would give it zero stars, if I could, this is by far the worse establishment I have ever been to, I don't even know how some of these people have jobs, the wait time is ridiculously long and not to mention the attitude of the employees, I will not recommend going here, go far away to another McDonald's, if that's what you really want, but do not go here",1
"As usual, it never fails to deliver... specially my cravings!..",5
Neutral,3
"This place was clean, but my order of a large drink and small fries took 16 minutes. There were only two  people ahead of me.",3
"For a prime, busy, tourist filled location, the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible.  Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.  Don't bother going here; it's not worth it, unless you want to feel like you're waiting at Disney at a subpar place.",1
Great burgers and fries!!!,5
Clean restaurant and good food,5
I always like their coffee :),5
50 cents for a water. Screw that. Rude employees and slow service. Never had such a bad experience at a mcdonalds before. It takes 45 min to get an ice cream cone. They either need to get better employees or a bigger establishment.,1
They serve good breakfast friendly people!,3
I don't recommend this place super poor customer service I can tell that employees don't have any training we ask for few items and pretty much they give whenever they want I hope the owner Reads this and do something I won't blame the employees I blame the owner for not having their employees ready,1

And the pizza and pasta, ""yes you read correct"" is delicious. Its like there own recipes and they got it right !!!",5
Waited on line for 45 mins just to place the order.,2
Like stepping back into the 70s.. this place hasn't been updated for many decades by the looks of it. Very old fashioned. Food a little greasy and saltier than other McDonald's branches I've been to.,2

"Say what you want about McDonald's, but this location has it figured out! I really hate that I forgot to take pictures for you guys, but go here! They have order kiosks and you can have your food brought to you by one of the staff.
Something that doesn't happen often with McDonald's, but this location really was clean. There was a modern aesthetic to it, along with the pastries (never seen at anothr McDonald's).
The food did take a while but considering the wait volume (-20/30) people, I can understand.
Overall, this is a great place for cheap food to go and to stay. If you're not specific about the way you like your food, order at the kiosk (get a table marker) and go on upstairs and find yourself a table.",5
Food could be warmer but it wasn't other than that it's near the Dallas zoo and is better than the other mcdonalds bear by.,4

"One of my favorite features of McDonald's for me is that I know what I can expect; offerings, flavors, etc.
This is true for this particular restaurant, however, it seems that being soooo busy (I guess excellent location) makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers.

Running out of lettuce, running out ""of many things"", are management/logistics problems. Bad attitude, lack of courtesy, well I guess that problem is on us, the customers, right?

The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still, regardless of attitude and bad manners.",2

It was fast,4
"I think this is the worst Mac Donalds I have been to . The worst customer service. A Spanish guy supposedly to be the Manager, was very rude to customers taking orders and was very  rude and nasty to  the employees giving orders.

He took my order and he didn't even know the menu. Gave the wrong order..
And he talked nasty to customers.

I think  MacDonald's head quarters should go and check up on this place specially on give a  training to employees and managers in how to  give an excellent service. But this is not a plasent place to have a Burger..

Sorry, for me I let my money there.. Shame on you MacDonalds.",1

"Terrible! Ordered an artisan grilled chicken sandwich and this is what I got. Old soggy lettuce. So that tells me the person preparing the sandwich just didnt care or that this restaurant does not care about keeping fresh items in their kitchen. $8 for this meal to get home just to throw out this sorry excuse for a sandwich. And this was after I had to go BACK through the drive through a second time because my son's happy meal was missing the fries. I mean isn't there a screen that shows what should go in the bags before handing to the customer? And after the second time through I got home to that trash sandwich and they also forgot the sauce for the nuggets, even through I saw it on my receipt so they knew I wanted it, and hot cakes without butter. Just carelessness on all fronts at this location. Oh and when I got to the pick-up window I told the woman I have a boy so please put a boy toy in the happy meal, and she said all of our toys are unisex. I will include a picture of his ""unisex"" toy. Take the time and drive pass to the next McDonalds along your route.",1

"Stopped in here on January 24th 2018 and ordered at the counter, a signature classic grilled signature sriacha chicken sandwich with an artisan bun. Paid for my order and waited. When my order was ready it was handed to me in a bag.I asked for ketchup and proceeded to a table to enjoy my meal. First off tge fries were crispy which I prefer, but they were old and not at all indicative of the worlds best fries. I took out my sandwich took bite and noticed sesame seeds in the box. I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun, proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns. I was pissed and walked off. I finished my meal, went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food. Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval. And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonald's and that I would be callong corporate. The following day I contacted McDonald's corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location. I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request. I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonald's is known. The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh. Thanks so much for taking the initiative to prepare my meal to the high quality McDonald's is known to deliver.",3

It was a very good interview with Eric. I will be excited to work there if hired.,5
"If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight. The employee (manager) handling the front end was the rudest individual I've ever met of all my visits to McDonald's in my 30 years. Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food. One lady said she'd been waiting on her food for over an hour. They wouldn't even accommodate her with a refund. Infact my order $25 took 40 min to fill. The store shut down the kiosks, as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby. I understand it's easy to get overwhelmed but when you're filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour, your prioritizing methods are failing. And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers. I'm on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again. But if I were a local, they would have just received their last $25 from my pocket. My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonald's in down town orlando, the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly. The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty. McDonald's, I'd fix this ladies attitude or I'd find her replacement.",1
Very clean and fast,5
It was so dirty that we have to clean a table to be able to sit.,1
The manger was really helpful,5
Ordered their signature Double BBQ Burger tonight at the drive thru... One patty wasn't even cooked.... The buns were burnt black instead of toasted. Fries came out cold. My wife ordered a #6 Chicken Nuggets with BBQ sauce.... Didn't get her sauce and nuggets were cold as well. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!,1
"Disappointing. The pictures of the food is inaccurate. Meals showing you get hashbrowns show no hashbrowns when you begin the order. Hashbrowns themselves ordered separately show two but you get one.

Deal on a large iced coffee was very good though. Also some of the staff especially this nice elderly lady was pleasant.",3
Typical fast food place. Impatient sometimes kirt employees.,3
"The Pacific Beach McDonald's is okay if you don't mind extremely packed places..... mostly young drunks/clubgoers, but otherwise an okay McDonald's. Expect long waits just because of the sheer amount of customers. Then again, almost anything beats the doldrums of the UCSD McDonald's.",3
If you need to drink coffee that's like gunpowder go to McDonald's leave your heart racing,5

Well that didn't last long... The new manager apparently didn't last.  It's still better than it was before though..",4
"Two days in a row while attending a convention nearby I stopped for a quick breakfast. They don't listen .... they don't care ... and they DON'T GET IT RIGHT.

I've repeated my request for something simple so many times in one day they should be paying me for the teaching experience. Product and service have sucked both days.

IHOP is acrossl the street. They listen. They get it right.",1
Excellent ,5
Breakfast,3
Great cooks here. But this building is filthy . Gross. And the servers are always unhappy.  I have to drive out of my way to get a better experience for my money.,2
I feel that it is OK to charge to use the restrooms. Yet they are so gross it's not worth it. Employees sneezing on Apple pies whipping hands on seat of pants. The new management is not any better. They where dumb to buy this one. If you have enough room to install two toilets then install two toilets! don't be ghetto and only have only one!,1

Very helpful and patient cashier and supervisor. Walk-in was very quick. Drive-thru was quite slow however.,4
Great times with the Akita crew!,5
Very good,5
Worst mcdonald's ever this morning I went inside no cashier they told me to use kiosk to order my food. I ordered and then had to wait 30 minutes this was so crazy and then I asked to speak with a manager and then I had to wait about another 15 min and then no staff members would speak English. They all need an attitude adjustment. I will never ever go to this Mcdonald's again never ever had to wait 45 min for a cup of coffee!!!! Please don't go and spend your money here!!!,1
"I live close so I frequent this location. They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they can't even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer. They just take the card, hand it back(most of the times without the receipt) and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word. Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff.",1

"We ordered our food (It was free egg mcmuffin day) and before we even sat down they brought it to us, clearly it was made before we ordered. It was cold in the middle. They proceeded to stare, whisper, and laugh at us. I was uncomfortable eating the food, afraid they had spit in it so we left without touching a thing.",1
the attention in this place is horrible.  the serving staff is really rude and unfriendly.  I do not recommend going to this branch of mc donald.  Your experience will be stressful,1

A racist appalling and unacceptable behavior by the security and employees occurred today at this McDonalds. My friend suffered a racist attack by some other white customer who asked the security to have them take my friend who is Hispanic out of the restaurant simply because of the white customers request. This is shocking and disturbing behavior and needs to be remedied and addressed immediately. This restaurant will suffer lawsuits very soon.,1

Really bad because the employees messed up my order and when i  call back instead helpings me the person who answer she just hanged me up. I tried to call back they just pick up the phone and hange up.,1
Great ,5
Evil,1
It's my local McDonald's so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru lane. But what's the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight. Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control. Food wise things take a long time usually but it's your normal McDonald's type food except they don't salt their fries well.,2
Great place,5
The team had no personality and had even had one employee on his cell phone while making orders.  The food I got had the fries lukewarm yet the burgers were fine.  They were more concerned with talking with themselves and not the customer.  Outside of that the place was clean and recieved my order in a quickly manner,3

"Unbelievably poor service. Ordered 3 items. 2 bagged immediately but then waited 15 mins for final item - a double cheeseburger. By this time first 2 items cold so asked for a fresh re order.  30 mins later! Walked out with barely an apology. Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel. Avoid if you can, don't expect if you cannot.",1

The lady at the drive-thru window was so rude and angry (for no reason) that I cancelled my order and drove away. The lady would only answer with one word answers and was not even polite. Drove to BurgerKing across the street where I was treated nicely and my order was completed with no problems or childish employees.,1

The worst McDonald's to get breakfast really early in the morning I always go try to get breakfast around 4 in the morning and there card reader is never working I don't understand how every day at 4 a.m. they can't accept debit or credit card this is been going on for a very long time,1
Of the fries we got they were cold. The small bad had about 10 if that. They did not add the ranch or BBQ sauce that we asked for. Horrible!,1
"We have always visited this branch when we are in Orlando. As always, food prices in this particular location is very expensive. You can not get the morning deal of $2.39 compared to other location in. South FL. It is $3.79 for chicken biscuit and if you want to add a hasbrown, it becomes  $6.79 and since you like to add a drink, you have to add $0.60 for a sweet tea. Small size hot coffee is $1.99.

The place is so dirty and I am not sure how they pass hygiene. They do not allow to order medium, only large at night. One of my order was not in the bag. When I checked the receipt, I noticed they have placed a wrong order. I told them about it, they said they dont have the item and refused to give refunds when I told them I do not want the wrong order. No apology and lie about I ever placed order they put in.  Very rude and ignorant. She did not speak English but deny about putting wrong order and accused me of placing order that I would never have placed. Food was cold and bread was hard as burn. Horrible experience with them and wish McD franchiser will take their license away. It is a disgrace to the brand. The management is so bad and I find the whole experience to be unbelievable.

Only go for the coffee but have to let them bring it to my car every time speed it up please,3
Terrible,1
"The staff could have been a little more attentive to people when they have questions. Instead they were all standing there talking not acknowledging people if they had a question including me. I had a question about the new disney 50th toys, whether I could buy them individually or only in the happy meal and she was like annoyed that I asked. One gentleman wanted to order at the counter and they just yelled from behind the counters you have to place your order at the kiosk, so he walked away. He wanted to pay cash and didn't know how to do it on the kiosk, but they didn't want to be bothered. I understand times are tough right now, I work in food service as well, but there is no need to snap and be rude to someone with a simple question.",3
"Terrible staff in general, I have never seen a worse McDonald's in my life. Super slow, 20 minutes on the clock to pay for the order since the payment kiosks did not work, without any order, without priority to attend to the payment, without smiling, they seemed bitter at work.",1
Always a bad experience at this McDonalds check your Oder before leaving guaranteed it,1
Great place to be.,5
Worse McDonalds ever! We waited 45 minutes for cheese,1

We got mcdonald's then we drove to San Diego and than I proposed to my wife at tuna park.,5
The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing.. security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still polite...you can eat on the patio but not for long...,4

Very quiet place and good attention,5
"I am done with this Mcdonald's ! I have been going there almost every morning and get a double biscuit and gravy. How hard is it to get a order correct.They charge me for it but I don't get it. It seems when a certain crew is working i get the worst service or no service. I have been told they have no gravy, no biscuits best one of all at 4 am they do not service breakfast due to corona. But waffle house does..",1

I love mcdonalds,5

"The management staff were bullying a new employee by telling her have needed to clean the dirty trays , the manger did this while the girl was taking my order, very uncool. The rest of the staff in the drive through laughed at the the poor girl and I was embarrassed for her.

"Unfortunately today while waiting in line (pulled to the side not in the drive through lane) my frappe was given to the person behind me. She graciously didn't take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it. I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back. I was very confused by this, especially in Covid times. I requested a different drink, no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe. The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again. Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this ",2
Serivce was horrible i walked in there asked for my drinks serveral times and the workers when lost and confused so i walked in a made my own ice tea then i appertantly caused a distrubance by doing that never going back here.,1

Good and fast that what you call fast food,4

Poor ,2
"The food was cold, French fries awful",1
The worst McDonald's I have been to across Texas!,1
This place is not good at all the manager Had an attitude when I went with my mom and a few friends we ordered our milkshakes and fries and when my moms friend asked for barbecue sauce and ketchup she realized that she wanted ketchup and buffalo sauce so she asked the manager and the manager said and I quote  Which one is it. Then my moms friend looked up and said buffalo and ketchup I guess,1
Love the frappe,5
Good ,4
"Food was fresh, but the new model of operations were there is no attendant to take your order ducks. I much rather talk to a human being.",3
Really good. Fast service. Food really hot,5
I've never actually gone inside this location but I use the drive thru fairly regularly. It's a pretty busy spot but even before they put in the dual-lane ordering system the service was always quick.,4
"Every time I go to this McDonalds near me they are rude and never smile. I don't mind so much but once in a while would be nice. It's the first place I came to eat once I moved here which wasn't a good sign and completely turned me off from a place I used to love to come to eat at.
Plus the homeless situation is out of control here. How about the security Dallas get off their phone and do their job? I literally haven't gone since in weeks because I'm asked for either a smoke, money or food every single time I go through drive-through. I'm sorry but I can't be buying someone else food everytime I go here. I just can't afford it.",1
Horrible absolutely Horrible! Never will I eat at this mcdonalds! I live in North County and I never had horrible service like I did today. Very slow staff... Angry managers! Very understaffed. They messed up a lot of orders back to back. There was a lot of people waiting for their order. They messed up my order twice and it took them forever to replace my order. There is homeless people here panhandling. Management is absolutely awful! They would never let a place like this run in North County... I expected more from this place. Worst experience ever. The staff had horrible attitudes. 10 min later I got diahrrea.... idk what they put in my food but definitely not coming back.,1

"I no longer will be going to this McDonalds on my commute from San Antonio to Kerrville once or twice a week . I was there today , and this is not the first time its happened, I ordered one thing and receive something not even close to what I ordered. I'm always in a hurry so I forget to check the bag. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo and when I finally was able to open the bag and opened the container I had a bacon cheeseburger with onions on it, not happy. Also the tea is never the same its always way too sweet are not sweet at all .  I did call the manager this time because I was fed up, he acted like he didn't even care. I would not recommend this McDonalds.",2
"Today Monday December 19 , 2016 This McDonald's Restaurant Has A Wonderful Services The Employees Name Is Miss Caprice & Very Happy & So Sweet & Very Helpful Food Is So Good The Morning Breakfast & The Hot Coffee & Ice Coffee Awesome The Big Breakfast Just Love It & They Have A Play Area For Your Kids To Run Around Fantastic Idea & Great Job McDonald's Restaurant Putting A Play Area For The Children To Play Around Perfect My 100% I Will Definitely Give You !!",5
Great price,5
"So, they can ring you up at the counter but you have to order through those machines? Ugh. Place smells like disinfectant and bleach, charges tourist prices.",2
"I stop here often only because it is on my way to and from work, but seriously this is by far consistently the worst McDonalds I have ever visited.  The milk shake machine is always broke down, as was tne case today.  I ordered a big mack, hold the catchup, fries and a diet coke. I even repeated myself to hold the catsup twice at the microphone and asked at the window again to insure she understood to hold the catsup on the burger and was meet with a very curt ""yes, I heard you"". Guess what , not only did they not hold the catsup but it was over loaded with extra catsup and I got a regular coke.  Well at least the fries were right.  I honestly believe the main problem is that the people taking orders at the drive thru speak poor English and obviously understand it equally as poorly, toped off with very poor customer service skills.  They s eriously act like the customers are a bother.",1
Every time I purchase a large sweet tea it's  unsweetened  when I purchase the double quarter pound sandwich it's  a single please correct or I will go some where  else,2

This is a VERY clean McDonalds,4
The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins. Even after you've ask. Then soon as you drive away.  You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to.,2
Mediocre service.,3
"I don't love it. It's an unfortunate weakness in my DNA that I can't be hungry. I was a hungry child and find myself eating fatty foods just to feel full longer. I know it's bad. It's only a convenience to go to McDonald's and it's cheap. I will try harder to be organic. It's what I dream of. Gold? No. I'm more of a silver lady. Arches? Again, No. Absolutely nothing memorable about MO. (Misery)",5
good,5
They dork up the kids meal every time and the fries are never fresh....but it's a standard place.,2
Paid for nuggets by time I walked all the way to my apartment approximately 25 minutes and we started to eat we opened up the food no nuggets,1
Dining room is supposed to be open until midnight.  I showed up at 10:55  and the doors were locked. The employees just ignored us,1
I went through the drive-thru the drive-thru was closed so I came in the kiosk was not working right and the lady would not take my order so I left,1

Water comes out brown the first time. Second time clearer but has bad taste",3
Open 24h for drive-thru. Burgers were good. The wait was insane. Maybe they had issues.,3

Okey,5
"Very busy, but It's nice and different types of food. From cakes to pasta and even pizza. Had the pizza and chicken alfredo they were surprisingly good and easy to go down. Doesn't compare to a good restaurant. But if your craving pizza or pasta can't go wrong",5
The food is ok. But the food was also already sitting out.m. But the garbage is overflowing outside and the ground outside is filthy. The workers look overwhelmed and overworked. There's a lot of garbage hanging out of the container. The bathroom smelled like it was cleaned with a dirty mop and pee. The woman at the counter was polite and nice. She makes this review higher than the one star this McDonald's deserves.,3
We was on holiday and stayed in the hotel opposite called the mandalay bay hotel on a room only basis (as is all USA hotels as far as I know) so for breakfast I nipped across the road (now that's a fun thing to do as they drive on the wrong side of the road!!!) The service was great albeit the staff was run off there feet most of the time (McDonald's get a fre more staff in as they need it in this place) food was as expected only one time did I get my coffee fix without any milk but it was OK,5
He told us we have to go back around to order a Coke and then they forgot one of my frappuccinos but the wine was out and down the street in LA I called the manager over she took care of it right away at least the frappuccino I didn't worry about the soda my honey didn't need one anyways bad for you but every non-stop there everything was fine and it was up to par,4
The burgers were cold,1
Much better than paying Mandalay prices.,4

"You guys do have mocha coffee, right? Cause sometimes ya'll think I'm talking about a frappe. And then I give up and ask for a regular. I mean I don't really care, but sometimes I suspect I'm being gaslighted. Like you guys know something that I don't. You know what I'm saying?

Where you keepin the mocha man",4
It's fast food so its hit or miss. Often the fry grease tastes old. The Tea fluctuations in sweetness can throw you for a loop going anywhere from bitter to syrup. Half the time late shifts miss part of your order and if they are busy sometimes the food especially fish and chicken wraps do not appear to be fully cooked. Other times its great?,3

Terrible customer service.,1

The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked. The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked, so kudos to him. Place was clean enough I guess.",2

My family was dining there and the people that was with us got their food way before us. I waited for an hour before deciding to inquire about mine and my daughters pasta dishes. I stood in line for about ten minutes when a member of management came. They went to look for it. Was just sitting under a heat lamp. We will never step foot in that McDonalds again. We ordered our food at 7:34pm and got our food at 8:45pm Shame on you McDonalds,1
Drive thru should be for walk ups to so we can order food also,3
Service excellent,5

"Ive never reviewed a fast food restaurant before because my expectations are never too high anyway. Fathers Day, drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for 25 mins. This one has two separate planes to order) The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles, when paying we were barely acknowledged, but the worse was to come. When at the next window to get our food.. the person did not even look at me.. literally just handed a bag out the window, then handed the drink out the same way..partially angled down towards me. Better yet, check out the new crispy chicken deluxe. ",2
A little dirty. Tables never clean.,1
I was discriminated by a drive Thru today for me being hard of hearing . Employees at this McDonald's are always extremely rude. They should be thankful in hard times like now they have jobs. Went thru drive thru w my kids was placing my order and cashier told me she would not take my order cause I was not fast she also said things that were rude and inappropriate.,1

Ordered a Chocolate Shake and they gave me a mixture of chocolate and mint. I drove back and asked them to fix it. They made me wait 5 minute and gave me a mixture of mainly vanilla ice cream. When I asked they told me thay the machine was not working right! What a ripoff!,1

The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3' ruled is. Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonald's conference in Orlando Florida. If I could give them negative stars I would. When you go through the drive-through there is not a proper greeting. It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order. There is no quality service. It's all about quantity, instead of quality.",1

Fast food drive through service was quick and courteous. Great! Dine-in was not available yet. I am looking forward to seeing the inside. Fun animal theme would be fun to enjoy with the kids after a day at the zoo.,5
I like the way they do the egg McMuffin with sausage here. I think it's just the muffins aren't toasted so much so they're a little softer everything else seems fresh and tasty. This one happens to have a bunch of one-way streets around it but soon as you know that you can figure out how to get in and out. Fast service in the Drive-Thru no complaints.,5

It would be nice place if you could enjoy your meal without people asking for money the whole time,1

The pies were reason we went there.  I got back to the hotel realized they weren't there. Went back she assured me she put 1 pie in the bag. I go back to the hotel find the reciept and my husband ordered two pies.  Instead of apologizing for error she said next time bring back the whole bag of food.  Obviously she knows nothing about the Aloha spirit which is prevalent all around the rest of the island.",1

We were 5 people and a large part of the order was missing. Fortunately, that was quickly arranged after having to wait again. Apparently upstairs where you can sit closed at 8 pm. Fifteen minutes before, a lady came to report that they were closing. She kept holding the door open until everyone had actually left. After 5 minutes we also left and the rest were able to eat in the rain. Something is seriously wrong there.",1

The staff is rude, and I'm always waiting for what seems like forever (usually 20+ minutes). The worst part about this place is that they consistently screw up EVERY order.

This place was amazing. The arcade upstairs was superior. The fish tank with the different fish was cute and how amazing was it to see a brick oven pizza,5
"Convenient location for a fast food restaurant, friendly staff, ample seating, quick turnaround time.",4

Great store!,5
"I'm sorry to give only one star. But during our visit were in the children's area 7 of 7 tables or seats are not clean. It was uncomfortable for me to sit there. There were many spots to see, unappetizing. if the area for the guests looks like, how is it in the kitchen. I do not want to imagine it. I will not go there a second time.",1

It was a little pricey. Just like eating in a real restaurant. $50 for a family of 4. But I'm sure it cheaper if you get normal meau things. We got noodles and pizza. It was plenty of food for the price.,4
"It's McDonald's,  what can I say?",3
Everything is overpriced and the fountain for drinks is behind the counter. AND they charge extra for mayonaisse,2
The employees are very rude one of them snatched a bag out of my boyfriends hands because they messed up our order and when we complained to the manager she laughed and did nothing about it. I would expect better seeing is how it,1
McDonald's is really good because the fries ect are really good,5

The service is always bad the employees are rude everything is always broke,1
"The MacDonald restaurants has served the best quality fast food for all ages for many years. For the last 20 years I have purchase the chicken nuggets and the consistency and flavor of the nuggets have not changed, they are just right all the time. Epifania, my 90 years old sister love the French Fry and the Grill Chicken Sandwich. Every time she has them she said  ""There is a whole chicken in this sandwich"" ""It is good for a lunch or dinner.""

It was cool but the bathroom was nasty!!,5
Never again will I order from here. 2 times ordered mistakes were made. Both were using the app so was apps fault but because they were short staff they could not find time to help and fix my order. Waited 20 minutes to leave with nothing and not even sure my order was canceled.,1

Both lines were long but fast service!,5
"It's alright. Although they need to upgrade on a few features especially public restrooms, even Burger King (in Waikiki Beach), is way smaller than McDonalds on Kalakaua, and it has bathrooms. What I dislike the most is when the employees forget my order, and then gives me missing pieces of the order, for example, you would order a Big Mac, 20 piece chicken nuggets, and a soft drink, and then they forget your chicken nuggets. And don't tell me you didn't experience this, all my years in Waikiki and yet they fail to exceed my order.",3
"Went inside to order because wife was dealing with kids.  No line ordered at kiosk right away.  15 workers and no one working.  Manager walking around say hello to customers and no one working. 17 minutes to get 4 egg McMuffins at 8 am

"Companies need to understand it's not 2020 anymore. The public is tired of your excuses. Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash, and mobile orders are not accepted, and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this. Maybe it's legit, seems shady though. If anything it is poor management. It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be. But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hours start, and the mobile app should not be accepting orders.",1
"Usually the lane in this location is crazy long but we thought we got lucky today because the lane was short. We placed our order and drove to the window to pay. We waited for about 3 minutes to be acknowledged. A young lady with a yellow shirt possibly a manager was facing her back to the window and she talked to the cashier. It took for me to honk in order for her to open the window to take my payment. Not once did she say anything to us. Not a greet nor an apology. Just took my credit card and gave me my receipt. I drove to the next window where another young girl was. She gave me my food and I asked her if the lady in the yellow shirt was a manager and she said yes. I then asked her for her name and she has the nerve to say "" I actually don't know her name I just got back but I'll ask"". What??? How do you not know who the manager on duty is. I left. The service was extremely poor for no reason at all. I ordered 2 happy meals and a nd chicken. I think that's an easy order. Horrible service. The manager did not look happy. As a matter of fact she seemed unhappy. She chose to work retail and chose to be a manager.",1

It's a pretty nice McDonald's. Not highest quality of food of course cuz it's fast food but I like the fries and getting deals. I've tried the mobile order a few times too and it's cool how they bring it to you and feels like there's less wait.,4
"Zari was absolutely incompetent! We specifically ordered 4 meals to be placed in 4 separate bags during the first stage of ordering (as they were for 4 people). When we requested this again at her window, she rolled her eyes, huffed, and began changing them out. She also gave me 3 Cokes and 1 diet Coke (for the diabetic in the group). They didn't mark the diet Coke so she told us that it was the wrong one! Luckily there was no need for a hospital visit due to her total lack of concern for safety and health!",1

Also, felt PUSHED, to use a Kiosk instead of the 2 girls at the COUNTER, why have ANYBODY UP FRONT IF US AARP PPL can't use their services? Never again!!!",1

Always busy and never a quiet moment. Owner of this franchise needs to actually enforce their solicitation policy before I ever try to come back.",1
So ehm what can I say? Italy is the best for the food of course and the chips are offended because you use the ketchup on them and I didn't ask for them. They are too much little soft and I bought them for too much. Paulino is the best! Anywayso I love the mec and bye,3

i am a tourist here . i came in the prices were already higher but that was fine the problem was the employees i ordered a rootbeer  but cashier didnt speak enough english to tell me he kept saying no ice. i stood there for 5 min waiting just a simple drink until another worker came over and explained they didnt have the drink and if id like to change. which i did pls retrain your employees and have someone with proper understanding at register so that theres no problem,1

"All those renovations in appearance makes no difference if the staff is unprofessional and simply ghetto. Then again it is in Newark smh. I was not aware that this particular Mc Donald's was not a corporate store, honestly I wouldn't know how to differentiate one from the other. In any case to my understanding every Mc Donald's ran the same policy in regards to the food they sell, obviously. So when I go to get my coffee, everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donald's does not honor that. The person at the register who's name is Estella (mexican woman) was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill. There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here. I should of took my business where I noramlly go which is the one located on Washington Ave, in Belleville. That just goes to show you how true the phrase is, ""Never judge a book by it's cover""!",1
Good McDonald's.,4
"Came in and ordered a Large coffee w/no ice. They handed me a cup that was less than half way full. I asked the employee, Flor, if they could give me a Large coffee w/no ice and she said no. I was willing to pay more to get a full cup of coffee. I always get a large sweet tea w/no ice and it",1

"They were cleaning surfaces while simultaneously serving food off them- and i dont mean they were drying, there was water sloshing. And bizarrely, my 10 piece mcnugget order was ready and bagged up on the counter before I even paid. I ordered at a kiosk, so no one overheard my order and acted fast... I got to the train station a block away and opened my food to find that my food was soggy and slightly brownish. Dont eat here at night.",2

"they have no respect whatsoever for the customers the food takes forever and to top it all of its not even good quality food  i went in there today and the employee was being super rude i just had a question about changing a sauce in one of the sandwiches and he answered me super rude ""if you dont like the sauce it comes with just change it ur f** self we don't get paid to do extra ""  he said. i was left speechless i didnt even know what to say i just think its ridiculous ..i dont know why he would answer that to me so i asked for his name and i asked to speak to a manager . when the manager came to speak to me she apologized for the behavior and told me he'd be reprimanded and as im walking out the door i just see them giggling with eachother i feel super disrespected . the manager didnt even bother speaking to her employee about the way hes talking to customers. idk if the guy was having a bad day or something but regardless nobody should be treated that way ..i just asked a simple question and i was treated like garbage . if it wasnt for people like me going and ordering food these people wouldnt have a job so it bothers me that i was treated this way will never be going back. for those of you who decide to go here watchout for roberto clemente he seems to have plug up his ass or something and he things he's entitled to speak to people like there less than him.",1

"The World largest McDonald's is a must to visit if you have kids. Besides the typical menu items, you can order pasta and pizza, customized to order. The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty. Only downside is the wait for the food ... about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it. Of course, the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade (a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from). The place was packed when we visited. Overall a good experience!",5
It was very quiet and clean. Good place to have breakfast..,4

Its okay when your hungry and in a rush,3
Good service unfortunately only 2 restrooms,3
Large choice of options from menu and service is fast,5
HORRIBLE! It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty. We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea. Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window. Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld. EVER!,1
Nice to sit inside after 2years. The tables didn't look sanitized after people had eaten  I could see grease and crumbs left behind  Also very disappointed they have no salads,4
"archer road in gainesville, the worst of the service, bad treatment to the customers, they give you the hamburguer without meat, in the nights there is never soda, they never take the order correctly",1

"Playplace was large and 6 year old had fun. Nowhere for disabled 13 year old to sit while brother played. Nowhere to put drinks while playing without occupying eating tables. Not enough tables for guests. Long lines at kiosk. Kiosk menu needs easier ways to find special items. Many people asking for help. Over a half hour looking for parking, had to park at another business and walk over. Needs more space. Staff was all helpful, manager was friendly, Italian section interesting to watch, restaurant was clean. Nice experience, only needs more space.",4

girl at cash register taking orders did not know how to do anything let alone help customers.. she said next  so I walk up to the register told her what i wanted and she walk off then helped a person that walk up to counter then walk back to the register and said next customer when I was standing right in front of her and never said sorry for at what can I get you.... somebody needs to train better,1

"Every McDonalds on the planet has the two sausage mcmuffin with egg for $3.33 special except for these guys. The lady taking the order says ""we don't have specials - there's too many tourists."" After getting a manager to translate ""can I have a receipt please"" to the cashier that spoke zero english, I took my overpriced food and split. The one positive is the three bums fighting in the parking lot did provide for some entertainment while I waited.",1
The kiosks are always breaking down and the cashiers don't like to place orders on the register. Besides the very poor customer service there are unfortunately alot of homeless people and junkies here that sometimes get violent and steal. I had my laptop stolen from this place. I reported it to the manager on duty since I sat in front of a camera but was not helped at all. Stay away from this place,1

There was also 2 other cars behind me that I assume she turned down also. I understand real restaurants not wanting to seat people so close to closing, but my drive through order wouldve only taken 5 minutes tops and I still wouldve been gone before 12. onalds is ",1

My husband's chicken sandwich came without any of the toppings and completely drenched in mystery dressing. Fries were super old and had that old grease fishy taste. Sodas (coke and Dr Pepper) were next to flat.

We were starving after a long hot day so, we just ate it and tried not to think about it.",1

I'm not really sure if yall just don't care or if this is really that hard.",1

Absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a Mcd's. The place was busy and lacked the people/system to handle it. Customers angry having to wait so long for food while others had to return theirs because of inaccurate orders. It took me 20 minutes to get a simple order - one chicken wrap with sweet tea.,3
Like for quick bite,4

decent breakfast,5
"The wait in the lines was a turn off but it's understandable because of it's location, there's a high demand because people seek fast food, something fast to eat. Just like any Mcdonald's location the meal will fill you but you may want to take it to go if you die for those peaceful eats.",5
"Very poor service! While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary. While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food. I dont often go to McDonald's but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression!",2
Nickel,5
The filth of the bathrooms is impressive. It is not possible to think that an internationally renowned chain maintains the bathrooms in that state.,1
Bummed!!! The girl behind the counter was so helpful. Pretty upsetting that ALL of the sandwiches in my order were wrong. Yay...my fries were right!,2
Very good,5
Had a great time here Maria is the assistant manager and was kind and helped me and got everything I wanted fast.,5
Enjoyed the service and food,5
"Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces (homeless and everything that goes with that), the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean, service helpful, and food good as always. We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids (no this, extra that), and each burger was put together exactly as ordered.",4
Long wait but after order it was fast.,5
"I can honestly say this is the world's worst McDonald's I have so far experienced. A 45-minute wait for a very simple and straightforward order. I've eaten in McDonald's all over the world, and the food quality and service let this one down severely.

"Messed up the order. Granted we had a group, so it was almost expected. However, instead of fixing it they copped an attitude and insulted my aunt. They didn't give us our drinks either and told us to go behind the counter and do it ourselves. The arcade was not even half working either.  Being a tourist area you'd think they'd be on par.",3
Horrible service. All the employees are always clueless. Came to pick up an order and the employee tells me order isn't ready so to park in the front. Waited 15 mins for another employee to come out and tell me that my order was given out already. Told him why did the other employee tell me they are still making my order and he is telling me it was given out already. Had no explanation. Made me waist 30 mins of my time.,1

"Extremely unreliable. Not enough staff to run the store. Sometimes no drive thru, sometimes OBLY drive thru. This is stupid considering theres more people",1
I felt so bad about how crazy busy they were that I wanted to jump behind the counter and help hand out bags! They did the best they could considering how hectic it was... and it was 11pm. It was pretty cool to see the kiosk that you can order from. Much rather order my food through that than a person.,3

This is the worst McDonald's in New York City. The heroin users congregate at the main table in front of the register and they harass customers as they come in. They nod off and just buy a soda or water to occupy the table for hours. There's homeless in front of the McDonald's and to the side and inside there's a lot of shady individuals that are just sitting there coming down off heroin highs. The service is mediocre and the atmosphere is gross. For it to be across the street from NYU this should be a whole nother level of security and quality.,1

I'd recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast. Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone it's like this.",4
"I'm on a diet, again, but the salad is great!",5

Need to update the menu because it's missing the breakfast items and the numbers. Other than that it's McDonald's!,3

Good deals and friendly service (most of the time). The drive thru wait time is always very long.,2
Food was hot! Still got homeless people begging for money not for food. And why are not the staff wearing gloves handling the food back there.?,5
"The service was aweful, the food was bad, the basic hygiene procedures were not being respected (the cashier went from touching money to pick up fries barehanded without washing her hands), and I've been sitting on my toilet for the last 15 minutes slowly dying",1

I understand mistakes happen but if I come back the next day and say hey, you charged me for a double quarter pounder and only gave me a regular quarter pounder maybe dont tell me yeah well if you don",2
Good fast location. They had a third window for you to pull forward to keep the line moving through the drive thru instead of having someone walk out to your car. It was super convenient and it did seem to save time. We will probably stop by this location again before our trip it over. You can't really go wrong with $1 cheeseburgers.,5

"Not open for pedestrians until 11am. I had to queue up with my legs, as if I were a car. When I got to the screen, noone answered me - guess it only responds to humans in cars. Helpful staff inside directed me to order this way, but it didn't work. If you don't have a car, don't bother!

Another thing is put cheese burgers were cold and dry! The frappes weren",1
The service was extremely poor as many customers had to wait a while for their food. The only reason I even gave it 3 stars was because the manager stepped in and took care of the customers. The food was good and fresh.,3

Ordered A doubble quarter pounder no mustard. 3xs came out with mustard. How hard is it and they want 15$ hour. I Don't think so.,1
Can not even order food they were not even incompetent enough to make an order.,1

"Service is incredibly fast. Just done with the register, not yet put back my wallet in pocket and my order is ready.  Workers are pleasant, patience and with no attitude mostly.  What I like most about it is that they do not impose any unnecessary rules and restrictions on people there plus incredibly pleasant and open minded with people from various backgrounds.

We got a pepperoni pizza and some alfredo pasta. You can see them cook these, which was pretty cool. They have an arcade upstairs and the place has tons of places to eat.",5

This location is said to be the largest McDonald's in the world! We stopped in after a day at Universal. We arrived after 11 and it was crazy busy. Our order took at least 30min before it was ready...but under the very busy circumstances it was understandable. They have unique dishes such as pasta and wood fired pizza which seemed very popular. Multi level seating....games room and various entertainment segments through the store as well to make the experience even better. Lots of free parking and dual drive thru. Overall this McDonalds is a flagship location for sure!,5
"""Hostess"" at the entrance had no desire to be there and wasn't shy about showing it, same went for the cashier. If you're used to Canadian prices... expect to pay almost double that. Crispy chicken had pickles on it and that's it, no sauce or anything... it also tasted like fish. Do not recommend. Beyond disappointing for being an ""attraction"".",2

If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got it. This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they get. What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for 30-40 minutes for a 10pc mcnugget meal?,3
It's McDonald's,4
They closed the drive thru early and would not take my order made me sit in the line for 15 mins before speaking and telling me there closed at 1:55,1

I asked them after 10 minutes about my order and they said it's coming up.  After 20 minutes I ask again about my order and the supervisor tells me ""one at a time, I can't skip your order in front of other people"".  She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people.  At 45 minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it.   Nobody gave an apology or acknowledged they were in the wrong.  If you can't run a restaurant correctly then please just shut down.  There are countless pictures on their reviews of cars piling up and terrible customer service.",1

"Hello,

I hope this email finds you to inform you that your staff needs to be engaged in coaching due to the lack of attention to a female and I needing to use the restrooms after multiple attempts to utilize them. I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said "" they just are "". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling ""I didn't have it my way "". And that's just a bowl movement. Thank you for your time and I hope this matter has been addressed the next time I pass by the store as I will try to obtain pictures of the staff reluctant to assist.

Best regards,

JJ.",1

Lost our order. Waited 45 min for a burger fries and a box of nuggets. Then they accuse us of trying to get a duplicate order for Free. They clearly have problems.  We tossed a twenty dollar bill at them and asked for the food. NEVER GO to this location.  EVER,1

Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow. I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins & a large french vanilla coffee. My wait time was approximately 10 minutes.
